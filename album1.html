            <hr>
            <p class="text">
           The emotional and substance abuse portrayed in “Born to Die,” the title track of Lana Del Rey’s first major-label studio album, <em>Born to Die: The Paradise Edition (2012),</em> establishes her signature “Sad Girl” aesthetic through a combination of lyrics, sounds, and visuals. This aesthetic emphasizes the overarching themes of existential longing and the loss of a lover, while offering little reflection on one’s own well-being. Analyzing these elements reveals a clear conclusion: the relationship depicted in this song realistically portrays toxic relationships in the modern world by highlighting the power imbalance between Lana and the “bad boy” archetype.<p>In “Born to Die,” Lana’s pessimistic love story details her desire for the warmth of another, particularly a dangerously controlling man, no matter the cost, because we are all “Born to Die” anyways. Accompanying the steady beats and orchestral strings, Lana sings the following lyrics, which perfectly encapsulates the narrative:</p></p>

  When these lyrics are sung, the “Born to Die” music video portrays Lana smoking while kissing a tattooed man, which symbolizes her acceptance of the relationship despite its challenges. She embraces her lover, even if the road to happiness seems long, because she finds solace in the relationship when she is high. This is typical in abusive relationships, as Tracy Herbert and her colleagues found in their journal article, “Coping with an Abusive Relationship: I. How and Why Do Women Stay?”, as the women who remained with their abusive partners were found to “…employ cognitive strategies that help them perceive their relationship in a positive light,” (Hebert et al. 311).

  Lana’s sultry, dream-like vocals emphasize the nostalgic tone of the song, making it seem as if she is reflecting upon a past relationship. As the music video progresses, we soon understand the darker reality behind this relationship, as during 1:39-1:46, the man is seen pointing a “finger gun” to her head and forcefully kissing her, with Lana clearly protesting. This moment illustrates the imbalanced power dynamic between the two, with the man coercing Lana into submission.

            <p class="text">
         Furthermore, the “finger gun” foreshadows Lana’s fate at the end of the video, as from 4:07-4:32, when she seems to finally move on from her relationship, the video pans out and shows the man holding her lifeless body after a car crash. It is unknown whether the man caused the crash on purpose or not, but regardless, the toxicity of their relationship had killed her.</p>

          Through this depiction, Lana creates a world where beauty and pain can coexist, which can be comparable to reality. In fact, she is directly applying “…her past story for her writing inspiration,” in this specific album, as Yulia Rakhmawati notes in her analysis, “Lana Del Rey’s View of American Glimmering Lifestyle and American Dream Reflected in Born to Die: The Paradise Edition Album: A Genetic Structuralism Study,” (Rakhmawati 293). Therefore, rather than glorifying the toxicity of these relationships, she is portraying a uniquely realistic perspective on the cultural issue of domestic abuse; “Born to Die” specifically serves as a reminder of the unjust reality when abuse is unchecked.</p>
