            <p class="text">
<p>During our in-class discussions regarding music, domestic violence, and sexual assault, Lana Del Rey stood out as singer-songwriter that I believe is often misunderstood when it comes to her portrayal of such topics. One profound criticism about Lana’s music is that it is inherently anti-feminist because her graphic depictions glorify domestic abuse. However, as stated in her own words, “I’m not glamorizing abuse,” but rather, “I’ve been honest about the challenging relationships I’ve had…That’s just how it is for many women,” (Savage 2020). Not only do I want to argue in favor of Lana’s narrative storytelling of these toxic relationships, but I want to expound upon them as a critical reflection on the cultural dynamics of power, gender, and vulnerability in modern pop music through an analysis of four of her songs: "Born to Die," "Blue Jeans," "Ultraviolence," and "Pretty When You Cry."<p>I believe a website works best when conveying my thoughts because it is interactive yet informative on a topic that is greatly interesting to me. In addition, I thoroughly enjoy challenging myself with projects pertaining to Computer Science—my major!</p><p>My project is original in the fact that there are seemingly no academic articles on this specific topic, thus my interpretation when it comes to Lana’s is inspired by both primary and secondary contexts.</p></p>

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
                The world of Lana Del Rey can be described as one compromising a desire for a beloved. Through this, “...a pantheon of enticing cultural icons arises,” especially when intertwined with her own perspective for achieving and maintaining a beloved. Lana seems to have "...such a total, non-moralistic, and in many ways uncompromising focus...” when it comes to desire. This is extremely important when understanding how desire fluctuates and evolves in relationships in the Western world, as mentioned in Per Bjørnar Grande's book chapter, “Desire in Lana Del Rey” (Grande 195-196). <p>In this case, descriptions of Lana’s “master and slave” dynamic with older men, followed by the gender imbalance and vulnerability of these relationships, is pivotal when analyzing her intentions and impacts of these songs. Thus, these will be the aspects of Lana’s songs that I will focus on in this project.</p>
